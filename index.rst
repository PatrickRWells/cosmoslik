To get started, :doc:`doc/install` CosmoSlik, read through the :doc:`doc/quickstart` guide, then look at the different available plugins (:doc:`doc/likelihoods`, :doc:`doc/models`, or :doc:`doc/samplers`). 

.. note:: Many of the pages in this documentation are IPython notebooks. If you download the `source code <https://www.github.com/marius311/cosmoslik>`_, you can run and experiment with any of the examples that you see.
