CosmoSlik
=========

CosmoSlik stands for **Cosmo**logy **S**ampler of **Lik**elihoods. 

CosmoSlik is a simple but powerful tool to quickly put together, run, and analyze a cosmology MCMC chain which can involve things like [CAMB](http://www.camb.info), [CLASS](http://www.class-code.net), the Planck likelihood, other cosmological likelihoods, your own customizations, [emcee](http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/), etc... It has advantages in ease-of-use, flexibility, and modularity as compared to similar codes like [CosmoMC](http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/), [MontePython](https://github.com/baudren/montepython_public), or [CosmoSIS](https://bitbucket.org/joezuntz/cosmosis/wiki/Demo1).
